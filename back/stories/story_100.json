He followed the river and came to a giant chocolate factory. He walked inside and saw that it was full of candy! He started exploring the factory and found all kinds of delicious candy. He ate some of the candy, but he was careful not to eat too much because he didn't want to get sick. He explored the factory for hours and then finally left to find his way back home.",
