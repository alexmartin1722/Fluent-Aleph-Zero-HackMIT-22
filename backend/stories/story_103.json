She stopped hanging out with her friends and stopped going to her job as a cashier at the grocery store. Gina's family and friends tried to reach out to her, but she just pushed them away. She didn't want to burden them with her problems. Gina felt like she was a burden to everyone and that everyone would be better off without her. She thought about suicide",
